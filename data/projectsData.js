    I plan to work on this more in the
    future with continued updates to make it better, if i knew about next at the time i would of made this app with it so i could get better seo on it by 
    having it server side, maybe i will refurbish it at a later time.

    I learnt a lot about react making this site, hooks and functional components make it such pleasure to work with and now after working with react
    in my last few projects i feel i understand react more than vue now, i didnt use redux for this app i decided to use useReducer and useContext
    for my state management and seems to work fine for now.

    This is my first react native project and the biggest project i have made so far, making this app i learn a lot about optimization and avoiding memory leaks,
     there are a couple problems with this app that i have found which i just cannot fix yet, one being that getting track metadata takes a long time, i read this
     is due to the react native bridge so that is unavoidable at the moment. The library i used has a batch reciever but it is not working at this moment in time...
     read more on github.
