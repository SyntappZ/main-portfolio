      In 2021 i have mainly been using react native and redux to upgrade my old apps, i fully upgraded my regex js app with react native/kotlin and works much better and better ux/ui,
      i had to learn some kotlin for this app due to react native limitations and i will continue to learn kotlin as it is very differnt than javascript and have been enjoying it.

      I am also working on my vortex player upgrade adding a redux state management system and also many of the problems in the old one fixed like the having to wait a long time
      to fetch the tracks over the react native bridge, this is now instant as it should be, it also has a full redesign and theme system, this app should be done by the end of march 2021.


      2020

      So far this year i have build my 2 biggest projects playist wizard and vortex player, both with react as vortex player
      was with react native, the 2020 version of this app is not working well and it took a long time to pull 
      
      In 2020 i messed around with node, express and mongodb just to get a feel with it, i built a couple of servers one included in this portfolio for the contact system,
      but nothing major built with a backend but atleast i get the jist of it and feel i will pick it up easy if i ever need to make a backend.`

      description: `After building projects with just js/jquery for a while i noticed some guy on youtube talking about a framework called vue,
    this looked so cool and would make my projects much better, after building a couple of sites with vue i tried out some other stuff like
    framework 7, ionic & angular.

    I managed to build a regex testing app with angular and put it on the playstore and even tho i found angular it bit harder to learn than vue
    due to the typescript, this app has 87 active users as of june 2020 so it mustn't be that bad, but this was the last time i used angular.

    This was the year i got into doing algorithms and challanges on codewars and i still go on there to this day, this really helped me become
    a better programmer as it not only made me better at problem solving it also helped me learn a lot more about javascript and programming
    such as higher order functions, recursion and destructuring.

    Next was react i loved learning react so much as it was so easy to learn as i already knew everything like components, lifecycle and state 
    from using vue, some of my biggest projects have been in react because its so flexible with jsx and react hooks i think its a great framework.
