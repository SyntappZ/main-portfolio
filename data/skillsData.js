      description: `So far this year i have build my 2 biggest projects playist wizard and vortex player, both with react as vortex player
      was with react native which was actualy one of the reasons that i decided to learn kotlin because as i built vortex i realised this app
      will never be the way i want it unless i build it as a pure native app with kolin or java, as of 22 june i have only learnt the basics of 
      kotlin but im getting there.
      
      As of 22 june i have built one server with express and node and database with mongoDB just to get firmilular with them, i also started
      to jump back into vue and learn nuxt so i can have my next app with a backend and also SSR, also this portfolio will be build with nuxt.
      
      To be continued...`

      description: `After building projects with just js/jquery for a while i noticed some guy on youtube talking about a framework called vue,
    this looked so cool and would make my projects much better, after building a couple of sites with vue i tried out some other stuff like
    framework 7, ionic & angular.

    I managed to build a regex testing app with angular and put it on the playstore and even tho i found angular it bit harder to learn than vue
    due to the typescript, this app has 87 active users as of june 2020 so it mustn't be that bad, but this was the last time i used angular.

    This was the year i got into doing algorithms and challanges on codewars and i still go on there to this day, this really helped me become
    a better programmer as it not only made me better at problem solving it also helped me learn a lot more about javascript and programming
    such as higher order functions, recursion and destructuring.

    Next was react i loved learning react so much as it was so easy to learn as i already knew everything like components, lifecycle and state 
    from using vue, some of my biggest projects have been in react because its so flexible with jsx and react hooks i think its a great framework.

       on to youtube and started making javascript/jquery projects, this is also where i found out about frameworks.
